## Introduction
Phylogenetic visualization of large multiple sequence alignments is difficult. Since phylogenies are reconstructed based on differences in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), tools that utilize only the positions with variation in the MSA could improve phylogenetic reconstruction and visualization.

## Project goal
We developed a drag and drop interface where the user provides (1) a vcf file and (2) a newick tree file and we render a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) visualization focusing on single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

## Prerequisites
- [Python 3](#python-3)
- [dendropy](#dendropy)
- [flask](#flask)
   - Install using python: `https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/`. Flask supports Python 3.7 and newer.
   - Install using conda: `conda install -c anaconda flask`
   
- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [Web-Interface](#web--interface)


# How to use our tool

## Installation
1. Download the `app.py` from "https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/beyond-phylogenies-team3/blob/main/app.py" in your current directory
2. The app can be simply run by executing `python app.py` in the user's command line interface (e.g. Terminal, Command Prompt).


## Input
Example VCF and Newick (also called New-Hampshire) file formats are provided in the  `example-data` folder. Upload the files at "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" then click "Visualize Data" and it will render.

## Approach
- Create two HTML pages one to submit files and the other to render them
- Create a Flask app to connect Python parsing and webpage output
- Utilize JS to create Drag and Drop system
- Alter React-MSA's underlying code to only show variants of interest

## Future Work
- Summarize nucleotides at reference positions
- Annotate phylogeny with other metadata
- Highlight items on the tree itself
- Real-time calculation of clade-defining substitutions
- Increased options and flexibility in design/algorithms utilized
- More fleshed out website and user interface
